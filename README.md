# CardioVascular-Risk-Determination

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project focused on determining cardiovascular risk. The study utilizes a decision tree classifier to analyze real-world data collected from gym members at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, during the early hours of the day.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can effectively assess an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on their waist-to-hip ratio. By analyzing key health indicators gathered from gym members, the decision tree classifier aims to identify patterns and correlations that contribute to cardiovascular risk.

## Data Source

* The data used in this research were collected from gym members at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.
* Data collection took place in the early hours of the day when respondents had not had their breakfast.
* The dataset comprises 350 real-world measurements of the waist and hip circumference of the participants' health and fitness.

## Methodology

* **Machine Learning Model:** A decision tree classifier was employed as the primary machine learning algorithm for this research.
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** This model was chosen for its ability to:
    * Handle both categorical and numerical data.
    * Provide transparent and interpretable results.
    * Identify complex relationships between variables.
* Further details on data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation will be provided in subsequent sections.


## Future Directions (To be added)

\* Potential areas for further research and improvement.
\* Ideas for expanding the project, such as:
    * Exploring other machine learning models.
    * Incorporating additional data sources.
    * Developing a user-friendly application for risk assessment.
